This project involves developing a town planning chat application with RAG capabilities and n8n workflow integration.

Initially, the focus was on resolving critical bugs:

ChatStream Content Handling: Fixing crashes due to non-string data types in renderMessageContent.
Session Management: Implementing robust session recovery, persistent chat history, and real-time updates via Supabase.
UI Architecture: Restructuring the navigation into a unified left sidebar with multiple tabs (Chat History, Sources, Actions, Map, Reports) and a dedicated right sidebar for reports.
Concurrently, new features were implemented:

Enhanced File Upload: Adding animated progress indicators, real-time updates, and error handling.
UI Consistency: Ensuring uniform styling and functionality across all new and existing tabs.
Reports Management: Enabling fetching, displaying (with markdown-to-HTML conversion), and downloading of reports from Supabase storage.
Technical requirements included verifying and fixing Supabase RLS policies, ensuring proper authentication, and utilizing React Query for state management.

Most recently, a critical build error related to an "Unterminated regular expression" in UI components was identified and fixed by correcting the regex syntax. The project is in continuous development, focusing on robust, production-ready code.
